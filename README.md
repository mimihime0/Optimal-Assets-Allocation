# Optimal Asset Allocation Project
This project aims to develop a program that determines the optimal allocation of assets in a given investment portfolio. *It is designed for eductional purposes only :)*

## Problem Statement:

You work for a prestigious investment firm that manages a large number of clients’ portfolios.
Your task is to develop a program that determines the optimal allocation of assets in a given investment portfolio. 
The portfolio consists of N different assets, each with an associated expected return and risk level. 
Your program should take as input the expected return and risk of each asset, along with the total investment amount available. 
The goal is to find the allocation of assets that maximizes the portfolio’s expected return while keeping the risk within a specified tolerance level.

## Project Structure: 

*This project is divided to two parts, this is the first part.*

### Brute Force Approach: Implement a brute force algorithm to exhaustively search all possible asset allocations within the given investment amount. Evaluate the return and risk of each allocation and find the one that maximizes the expected return while keeping the risk within the specified tolerance level.

## Contents:
